<h1>...by way of an explaination...</h1>
<p>I’ve been reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science">Chaos by James Gleick</a> and decicded to have a play with some of the equations. I found a nice example in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html">deSolve</a> package vignette: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system">Lorenz equations</a>. These are a classic example of a system of equations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaotic solutions</a> for certain parameters. Although the web must be littered with similar apps, I decided to make a Shiny implementation of <a href="https://github.com/bobturneruk/lorenz">my code</a> so I could play with the parameters! The equations in my model are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{dX}{dt}=aX+YZ, \frac{dY}{dt}=b(Y-Z), \frac{dZ}{dt}=-XY+cY-Z\]</span></p>
<p>The pre-set parameters result in chaotic output. Shortening the duration of the model lets you see more detail in the time series and how periods of what look like “order” emerge. It is possible to find combinations of parameters that seem to lead to steady-states for some of the variables (over the duration of the model).</p>
